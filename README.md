# ar-project
This AR project uses AR.js, an open-source library for augmented reality on the web, combined with A-Frame, a framework for building 3D and VR experiences. The project includes a custom marker (pattern-marker.png) and a simple 3D box that appears when the marker is detected by the user's camera.
